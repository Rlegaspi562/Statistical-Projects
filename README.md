<!---
Objective & Motivation: What you were trying to do, and why
Role: Make it clear if it is a personal Project or if you were part of a team. If personal give a sense of the effort (e.g. x hours / week outside of core curriculum) you put in; if part of a team clarify your responsibilities
Data: Detail the approximate dataset size and skew, how (e.g., software and techniques used) to store, extract and clean the data
Models: Specify models and statistical techniques used, as well as programming languages and libraries used to construct them (paying particular attention here to the requirements noted on the job posting - the more you can cover off keywords/asks for the role the better!)
Code: It is worth linking to your Github account to give the Hiring Manager the option to check out the code (plus it just makes it all the more credible that you’ve actually done the work!). A bonus option here is to also create a readme.md for the projects you’re featuring on your resume - this template is a good example
Results: Try whenever possible to demonstrate the outcome with numerical impact or significance (it pops off the resume more than a text-only sentence) and is an indicator of how impact-oriented (or not!) you are in your work
If you follow the above high-level and specific advice your Project work should start to work for you! -->

* ##  [Predicting Home Sales Prices Using Multiple Linear Regression Part 1](https://github.com/Rlegaspi562/Statistical-Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Home%20Prices%20Using%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression/Predicting%20Home%20Sales%20Prices%20Using%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression%20Analysis%20Pt.%201.pdf)


Objective & Motivation: The city tax assessor is interested in predicting residential home sales prices in a midwestern city given a dataset of various characteristics of the home and surrounding property. The feautures we use to predict sales price of a home are number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and garage size. 

Role: Statistician

Data: Our dataset consists of 522 total transactions from home sales in a midwestern city during the year 2002.

Models and statistical techniques:  Used R as the main programming language to conduct statistical analysis and Rmarkdown to knit and export results into a PDF
- Model Estimation and Interpretation
  - Fitting a Multiple Linear Regression model
  - Adjusted R-Squared
- Prediction
  - 95% Confidence Interval
  - 95% Prediction Interval
- Hypothesis Testing
  - T-test for partial slope significance
  - F-Test for Overall model significance
  - Partial F-Test to assess reduced and full model significance
- Multicolinearity
  - Scatterplots
  - Correlation Matrices

Results: 

Try whenever possible to demonstrate the outcome with numerical impact or significance (it pops off the resume more than a text-only sentence) and is an indicator of how impact-oriented (or not!) you are in your work
